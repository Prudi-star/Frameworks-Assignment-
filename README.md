# 📊 CORD-19 Data Explorer

This is a beginner project to explore the **CORD-19 metadata dataset**.  
It uses **pandas** for data handling, **matplotlib** for charts, and **Streamlit** for a simple web app.  

---

## 🚀 Steps I Did
1. Loaded the dataset (`metadata.csv`)  
2. Cleaned the data (fixed missing values, extracted year)  
3. Made two visualizations:  
   - Publications by Year  
   - Top Journals  
4. Built a Streamlit app with a slider for selecting year range
